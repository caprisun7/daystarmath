## Example 1

**Problem**

The equation of line $t$ is 

$$x + 3y = -15$$ 

Parallel to line $t$ is line $u$, which passes through the point $(-8, 5)$. What is the equation of line $u$?

**Solution**

$$
\begin{align*}
x + 3y &= -15 \\
y &= -\frac{1}{3}x - 5 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Gradient of line $t$ is $-\frac{1}{3}$, so gradient of line $u$ is $-\frac{1}{3}$

$$
\begin{align*}
y &= -\frac{1}{3}x + c \\
5 &= -\frac{1}{3}(-8) + c \\
c &= 5 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \\
y &= -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3} \\
\end{align*}
$$


## Practice 1.1

**Problem**

The equation of line $g$ is $x - y = -7$. 

Line $h$, which is parallel to line $g$, passes through the point $(1, -7)$. 

What is the equation of line $h$?

**Answer**

$$y=x-8$$

## Practice 1.2

**Problem**

Find the equation of a line passes through (-4,-3), which is also parallel to another line passing through (-9, 7) and (-12, 3).

**Answer**

$$y=\frac{4}{3}x+\frac{7}{3}$$

## Practice 1.3

**Problem**

The equation of a straight line AB is 

$$
\frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{2} = 1
$$

Find the equation of the line PQ which is parallel to the line AB and passes through a point (2, -8).

**Answer**

$$
y=-x-6
$$


## Example 2

**Problem**

Line $v$ has an equation of 

$$2x - 3y = 9$$

Line $w$, which is perpendicular to line $v$, includes the point $(2, 2)$. 

What is the equation of line $w$?

**Solution**
$$
\begin{align*}
2x - 3y &= 9 \\
-3y &= -2x + 9 \\
y &= \frac{2}{3}x - 3
\end{align*}
$$

Gradient of line $v$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, so gradient of line $w$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$

$$
\begin{align*}
y &= -\frac{3}{2}x + b \\
2 &= -\frac{3}{2}(2) + b \\
2 &= -3 + b \\
5 &= b \\
y &= \frac{2}{3}x+5
\end{align*}
$$

## Practice 2.1

**Problem**

$$
\frac{x}{3} + \frac{y}{4} = 1
$$
