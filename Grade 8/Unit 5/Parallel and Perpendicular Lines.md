## Example 2
**Problem**

Line $v$ has an equation of 

$$2x - 3y = 9$$. 

Line $w$, which is perpendicular to line $v$, includes the point $(2, 2)$. 

What is the equation of line $w$?

**Solution**
$$
\begin{align*}
2x - 3y &= 9 \\
-3y &= -2x + 9 \\
y &= \frac{2}{3}x - 3
\end{align*}
$$
Gradient of line $w$ is $\frac{2}{3}$
