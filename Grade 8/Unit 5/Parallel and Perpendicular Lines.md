## Practice 1.1

**Problem**

The equation of line $g$ is $x - y = -7$. Line $h$, which is parallel to line \( g \), includes the point \( (1, -7) \). What is the equation of line \( h \)?


## Example 2

**Problem**

Line $v$ has an equation of 

$$2x - 3y = 9$$. 

Line $w$, which is perpendicular to line $v$, includes the point $(2, 2)$. 

What is the equation of line $w$?

**Solution**
$$
\begin{align*}
2x - 3y &= 9 \\
-3y &= -2x + 9 \\
y &= \frac{2}{3}x - 3
\end{align*}
$$

Gradient of line $v$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, so gradient of line $w$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$

$$
\begin{align*}
y &= -\frac{3}{2}x + b \\
2 &= -\frac{3}{2}(2) + b \\
2 &= -3 + b \\
5 &= b \\
y &= \frac{2}{3}x+5
\end{align*}
