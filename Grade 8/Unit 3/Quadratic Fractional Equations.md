## Example 1

**Problem:**

Solve the equation:

$$ \frac{4}{p} - \frac{5}{p+3} = \frac{p+8}{(p+3)^2} $$

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{align*}
4(p+3)^2 - 5p(p+3) &= (p+8)p \\
4(p^2 + 6p + 9) - 5p^2 - 15p &= p^2 + 8p \\
-p^2 + 9p + 36 &= p^2 + 8p \\
2p^2 + 8p - p^2 - 9p - 36 &= 0 \\
2p^2 - p - 36 &= 0 \\
(2p-9)(p+4) &= 0 \\
2p - 9 = 0 \quad &\text{or} \quad p + 4 = 0 \\
p = 4.5 \quad &\text{or} \quad p = -4 \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Example 2

**Problem:**

Solve the equation:

$$ \frac{1}{4x^2 - 4x + 1} + \frac{3}{1-2x} = 4 $$

**Solution:**
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{(2x - 1)^2} + \frac{3}{1-2x} &= 4\\
\frac{1}{(2x - 1)^2} - \frac{3}{2x-1} &= 4\\
1 - 3(2x - 1) &= 4(2x - 1)^2
\end{align*}
$$
Multiply through by $$ (2x - 1)^2 $$ to clear the fractions:

$$ 1 + 3(2x - 1) = 4(2x - 1)^2 $$

Expand and simplify:

$$ 1 + 6x - 3 = 16x^2 - 16x + 4 $$

Combine like terms and move everything to one side:

$$ 0 = 16x^2 - 16x + 4 - 6x + 2 $$

$$ 16x^2 - 22x + 6 = 0 $$

Divide through by 2 to simplify:

$$ 8x^2 - 11x + 3 = 0 $$

Factor the quadratic equation:

$$ (8x - 3)(x - 1) = 0 $$

Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $$ x $$:

$$ 8x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 1 = 0 $$

$$ x = \frac{3}{8} \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 $$

Therefore, the solutions are $$ x = \frac{3}{8} $$ and $$ x = 1 $$.

**Criteria C Question: Why do we factorise before clearing the fractions**

If we were to clear the fractions without factorising, we'd have to multiply by the least common denominator $$ (4x^2 - 4x + 1)(2x - 1) $$, which is more complex and could lead to more complicated algebra than necessary. Recognizing the square trinomial simplifies this to just $$ (2x - 1)^2 $$, making the algebra more manageable.
