# Question 1
By completing the square, solve the equation $$x^2 + 2x - 5 = 0$$. Leave your answers in the form $$a \pm \sqrt{b}$$, where a and b are integers.

# Question 2
Solve $$x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0$$ by using the completing square method.

# Question 3
Solve $$x^2 - \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} = 2$$ by using completing the square method.

Which number must be added to the left hand side of the equation to get a perfect square? Explain your reasons clearly.

Why do you then subtract the same number immediately after adding it. Explain your reasons clearly.

# Question 4
By using “completing the square”, solve $$16y^2 + 14y - 10 = 0$$ leaving your answers in surd form.

Why must you clear the coefficient of $$y^2$$ before completing the square?

# Question 5
(a) What must be added to $$x^2 - \frac{7}{5}x$$ to obtain a perfect square? Explain why using the perfect square formula.

(b) Using the above, solve $$\frac{14}{15}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2 = 0$$, leaving your answers as fractions.
