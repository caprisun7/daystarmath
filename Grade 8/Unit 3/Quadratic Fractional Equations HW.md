# Question 1
Solve $$ \frac{x+1}{3-2x} - \frac{3x-14}{4x^2-9} = 0 $$.

Why is factorization needed before clearing the fraction?

# Question 2
Solve the equation $$ 2x + \frac{1}{x} = 7 - \frac{3}{x} $$.

# Question 3
Solve $$ \frac{8x^2 + 14x - 7}{3x + 7} $$.

# Question 4
Solve $$ \frac{3x}{x+1} = \frac{x-2}{2x^2-x-3} $$.

# Question 5
Solve $$ \frac{20}{x} - \frac{20}{x+3} = 4 $$.

What do you need to multiply both sides by to clear the fraction and why?

# Question 6
Solve the equation $$ 2x - \frac{2 + 3x}{4} = \frac{2}{x} $$.

# Question 7
Solve the equation $$ (4-y)^2 = \frac{3y-1}{2y+5} $$.

# Question 8
Solve the following quadratic equation. $$ \frac{2x-1}{3x-1} = \frac{4x+1}{3} $$.

# Question 9
Solve the equation $$ \frac{4x+2}{11} = \frac{2}{x-4} $$.

# Question 10
Solve $$ \frac{2+x}{6x^2-23x+20} - \frac{1}{5-2x} = \frac{1}{3} $$.

What do you need to multiply both sides by to clear the fraction and why?

# Question 11
Solve $$ \frac{5}{x-4} - \frac{x+10}{x^2-2x-8} = 20 $$, giving your answers correct to 2 decimal places.

# Question 12
Solve $$ \frac{x+2}{x^2-5x+6} - \frac{x}{4x-12} = \frac{13}{8} $$.
