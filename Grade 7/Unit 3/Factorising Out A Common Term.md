Example 1:
Factorise $$ 24a + 21 $$ completely.
$$ 3(8a + 7) $$

Example 2:
Factorise $$ xy + 2y $$ completely.
$$ y(x + 2) $$

Example 3:
Factorise $$ 16xy + 20xw $$ completely.
$$ 4(4xy + 5xw) $$

Example 4:
Factorise $$ 4ab + 2ac - 8ad $$ completely.
$$ 2(2ab + ac - 4ad) $$

Example 5:
Factorise $$ 100x^2 - 3x $$ completely.
$$ x(100x - 3) $$

Example 6:
Factorise $$ 81xy + 9xyz $$ completely.
$$ 9(9xy + xyz) $$

Example 7:
Factorise $$ 4s^2t - 36t^2 $$ completely.
$$ 4t(s^2 - 9t) $$

Example 8:
Factorise $$ x^3 + x^2 $$ completely.
$$ x^2(x + 1) $$

Example 9:
Factorise $$ 12m^3p - 30m^2p + 21mp^2 $$ completely.
$$ 3m^2p(4m - 10 + 7p) $$

Example 10:
Factorise $$ 5g^2h + 15g^3h + 20g^2h^2 $$ completely.
$$ 5g^2h(1 + 3g + 4h) $$
