### Example 1: Factorize $$ 5x^2 + x - 6 $$

By Cross Method:

  |  5x  |  6  |
  |  x   |  -1  |

Cross multiplication gives us:

- $$ 5x \times -1 = -5x $$
- $$ x \times 6 = 6x $$

These add up to the middle term $$ x $$.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (5x - 6)(x - 1) $$
 
**Self-explanation question 1 (Criteria C): Why can't we use the sum and product method and get the answer $$ (x+3)(x-2) $$?**

The sum and product method is based on the formula $$(x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab$$. This formula always results in a quadratic expression where the coefficient of $$x^2$$ is 1. In our question we have $$ 5x^2 $$ so the coefficient of $$ x^2 $$ is 5, which means the sum and product method doesn't apply.

### Example 2: Factorize $$ 3x^2 + 5x + 2 $$
By Cross Method:

  |  3x   |   2  |
  |  x    |   1  |


Cross multiplication gives us:

- $$ 3x \times 1 = 3x $$
- $$ x \times 2 = 2x $$

These add up to the middle term $$ 5x $$.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (3x + 2)(x + 1) $$

### Example 3: Factorize $$ 3x^2 - 5x - 2 $$
Note that compare with the last example, we still have to make $$ 5x $$ in the middle, only this time we need to make $$ -5x $$. So let's change to:

  | 3x   | -2   |
  | x   |  -1  |

Cross multiplication gives us:

- $$ 3x \times -1 = -3x $$
- $$ x \times -2 = -2x $$

These add up to the middle term $$ -5x $$.

However, this is incorrect.

**Self-explanation question 2 (Criteria C): Why is this incorrect?**
The two number in the last column must mutiply to $$ -2 $$, however we have $$ -2 $$ and $$ -1 $$ in the last column and $$ -2 \times -1 = 2 $$.

Is there another way to make $$ -5x $$ as well as giving the product of $$ -2 $$? Closer inspection reveal another combination:

  | 3x   | 1   |
  | x   |  -2  |

- $$ 3x \times -2 = -6x $$
- $$ x \times 1 = x $$

These add up to the middle term $$ -5x $$.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (3x + 1)(x - 2) $$

### Example 4: Factorize $$ 3x^2 - 5x + 2 $$

By Cross Method:

  | 3x   |  -2  |
  | x    |  -1   |

As we have seen before, cross multiplication gives us $$ -5x $$ and the product of last column give positive 2.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (3x - 2)(x - 1) $$
