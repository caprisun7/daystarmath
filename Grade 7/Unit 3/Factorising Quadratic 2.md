### Example 1: Factorize $$ 16x^2 - 25x + 9 $$

By Cross Method:

  |  16x  |  -9  |
  |  x    |  -1  |

Cross multiplication gives us:

- $$ 16x \times -1 = -16x $$
- $$ x \times -9 = -9x $$

These add up to the middle term $$ -25x $$.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (16x - 9)(x - 1) $$

### Example 2: Factorize $$ 24c^2 + 35c + 9 $$
By Cross Method:

  |  8c   |   9  |
  |  3c   |   1  |


Cross multiplication gives us:

- $$ 8c \times 1 = 8c $$
- $$ 3c \times 9 = 27c $$

These add up to the middle term $$ 35c $$.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (8c + 9)(3c + 1) $$

### Example 3: Factorize $$ 15c^2 + 14c - 8 $$

By Cross Method:

  | 5c   | -2   |
  | 3c   | +4   |


Cross multiplication gives us:

- $$ 5c \times +4 = +20c $$
- $$ 3c \times -2 = -6c $$

These add up to the middle term $$ +14c $$.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (5c - 2)(3c + 4) $$

### Example 4: Factorize $$ 8m^2 - m - 30 $$

By Cross Method:

  | 8m   | +15  |
  | m    | -2   |

Cross multiplication gives us:

- $$ 8m \times -1 = -8m $$
- $$ m \times +9 = +9m $$

These combine to form the middle term $$ -m $$.

Therefore, the factors are:

$$ (8m + 15)(m - 2) $$
