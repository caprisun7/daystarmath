# Lecture Notes on Expanding Expressions of the Form $$(x + a)(x + b)$$

## Introduction

When we have an expression in the form $$(x + a)(x + b)$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are constants (which can be positive or negative), we can expand it using the distributive law. This process involves multiplying each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket and then combining like terms.

## Example 1: Both $$a$$ and $$b$$ are Positive

### Problem: Expand $$(x + 3)(x + 4)$$

#### Solution:

1. Apply the distributive law:
   $$ (x + 3)(x + 4) = x(x + 4) + 3(x + 4) $$
2. Expand each term:
   $$ = x \cdot x + x \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot x + 3 \cdot 4 $$
3. Simplify:
   $$ = x^2 + 4x + 3x + 12 $$
4. Combine like terms:
   $$ = x^2 + 7x + 12 $$

#### Self-Explanation Prompts:

- Why do we apply the distributive law in step 1?
- How does expanding each term in step 2 help in simplifying the expression?
- What is the purpose of combining like terms in step 4?

### Answers to Self-Explanation Prompts:

- The distributive law is applied to multiply each term in one bracket by each term in the other. This ensures that all possible products are accounted for.
- Expanding each term makes it clear what terms we have and how they can be combined.
- Combining like terms simplifies the expression into a more manageable form, making it easier to understand or use in further calculations.

## Example 2: Both $$a$$ and $$b$$ are Negative

### Problem: Expand $$(x - 2)(x - 5)$$

#### Solution:

1. Apply the distributive law:
   $$ (x - 2)(x - 5) = x(x - 5) - 2(x - 5) $$
2. Expand each term:
   $$ = x \cdot x - x \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot x + 2 \cdot 5 $$
3. Simplify:
   $$ = x^2 - 5x - 2x + 10 $$
4. Combine like terms:
   $$ = x^2 - 7x + 10 $$

#### Self-Explanation Prompts:

- Why does the term $$-2(x - 5)$$ become $$-2x + 10$$ after expansion?
- What is the significance of the negative signs in front of $$a$$ and $$b$$?

### Answers to Self-Explanation Prompts:

- The term $$-2(x - 5)$$ is expanded by distributing $$-2$$ across both terms in the bracket, resulting in $$-2x + 10$$. The negative sign in front of the 2 changes the signs of the terms inside the bracket upon multiplication.
- The negative signs in front of $$a$$ and $$b$$ indicate subtraction. They affect the signs of the terms when expanded and combined, leading to different coefficients in the final expression.

## Example 3: One Negative and One Positive

### Problem: Expand $$(x + 6)(x - 3)$$

#### Solution:

1. Apply the distributive law:
   $$ (x + 6)(x - 3) = x(x - 3) + 6(x - 3) $$
2. Expand each term:
   $$ = x \cdot x - x \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot x - 6 \cdot 3 $$
3. Simplify:
   $$ = x^2 - 3x + 6x - 18 $$
4. Combine like terms:
   $$ = x^2 + 3x - 18 $$

#### Self-Explanation Prompts:

- How does the presence of one negative and one positive constant affect the expansion?
- Why do we get a different type of term (positive and negative) in the final expression?

### Answers to Self-Explanation Prompts:

- The presence of one negative and one positive constant leads to a mix of positive and negative terms when expanded. This is because the negative constant introduces subtraction, while the positive constant introduces addition.
- The different types of terms in the final expression result from the combination of positive and negative products. The signs of the constants dictate whether the terms they produce upon expansion add to or subtract from the total value of the expression.

## Reflective Exercise for Students

### Understanding the Impact of Numbers in the Brackets on the Expanded Expression

After exploring the examples of expanding expressions in the form $$(x + a)(x + b)$$, it's important to delve deeper into how the numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ in the brackets influence the final expanded form. Specifically, focus on how these numbers affect the coefficient of the $$x$$ term and the constant term in the expanded expression.

#### Questions for Consideration:

1. **Observing Patterns:** Look back at the examples provided. How do the values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ relate to the coefficient of the $$x$$ term and the constant term in each expanded expression? Can you identify a pattern?
2. **Coefficient of $$x$$:** In each example, the coefficient of $$x$$ is obtained by adding $$a$$ and $$b$$. Why does this happen? How does changing $$a$$ and $$b$$ (either increasing or decreasing their values) affect the coefficient of $$x$$?
3. **Constant Term:** The constant term in the expanded expression is the product of $$a$$ and $$b$$. How does this product change when $$a$$ and $$b$$ are both positive, both negative, or when one is positive and the other is negative? What does this tell you about the relationship between the signs of $$a$$ and $$b$$ and the sign of the constant term?
4. **Generalization:** Can you generalize a rule for predicting the coefficient of $$x$$ and the constant term in the expanded form of $$(x + a)(x + b)$$ just by looking at $$a$$ and $$b$$?

#### Purpose of This Exercise:

- **Deepening Understanding:** This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of how algebraic expressions are influenced by their individual components. By analyzing the roles of $$a$$ and $$b$$, you gain insight into the structure of algebraic expressions.
- **Developing Predictive Skills:** By recognizing patterns, you can start to predict the form of expanded expressions without fully expanding them. This skill is particularly useful in more complex algebraic manipulations.
- **Appreciating Algebraic Structure:** Understanding these relationships helps in appreciating the beauty and consistency of algebraic structures, making it easier to grasp more advanced concepts in the future.

### Answers to Reflective Exercise Questions

#### 1. Observing Patterns:

- In each example, the coefficient of the $$x$$ term is the sum of $$a$$ and $$b$$, and the constant term is the product of $$a$$ and $$b$$. For instance, in $$(x + 3)(x + 4)$$, the coefficient of $$x$$ is $$3 + 4 = 7$$, and the constant term is $$3 \times 4 = 12$$. This pattern holds regardless of the signs of $$a$$ and $$b$$.

#### 2. Coefficient of $$x$$:

- The coefficient of $$x$$ in the expanded form is the sum of $$a$$ and $$b$$ because when the expression is expanded, the terms involving $$x$$ are $$ax$$ and $$bx$$. Adding these gives $$ax + bx = (a + b)x$$. Changing $$a$$ and $$b$$ alters this sum, directly affecting the coefficient of $$x$$. For example, if $$a$$ and $$b$$ increase, the coefficient of $$x$$ increases, and vice versa.

#### 3. Constant Term:

- The constant term is the product of $$a$$ and $$b$$. When both are positive, their product is positive. When both are negative, their product is still positive (since multiplying two negatives gives a positive). However, if one is positive and the other is negative, their product is negative. This demonstrates that the sign of the constant term depends on the signs of $$a$$ and $$b$$. It's positive if $$a$$ and $$b$$ have the same sign and negative if they have opposite signs.

#### 4. Generalization:

- A general rule can be formulated: In the expanded form of $$(x + a)(x + b)$$, the coefficient of $$x$$ will always be $$a + b$$, and the constant term will always be $$a \times b$$. This rule allows for quick predictions about the expanded form based on the values and signs of $$a$$ and $$b$$. For example, if $$a$$ and $$b$$ are both large positive numbers, the coefficient of $$x$$ will be large, and the constant term will be even larger. Conversely, if one is large and positive and the other is large and negative, the coefficient of $$x$$ will be small (or even zero if $$a$$ and $$b$$ are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign), and the constant term will be large and negative.

#### Conclusion:

Understanding these patterns and rules is crucial for efficiently expanding and manipulating algebraic expressions. It not only simplifies the process of expansion but also provides a deeper insight into the structure and behavior of polynomial expressions. This knowledge is foundational for further studies in algebra and calculus.
