# Lecture Notes on Expanding Expressions of the Form $$(x + a)(x + b)$$

## Introduction

When we have an expression in the form $$(x + a)(x + b)$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are constants (which can be positive or negative), we can expand it using the distributive law. This process involves multiplying each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket and then combining like terms.

## Example 1: Both $$a$$ and $$b$$ are Positive

### Problem: Expand $$(x + 3)(x + 4)$$

#### Solution:

1. Apply the distributive law:
   $$ (x + 3)(x + 4) = x(x + 4) + 3(x + 4) $$
2. Expand each term:
   $$ = x \cdot x + x \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot x + 3 \cdot 4 $$
3. Simplify:
   $$ = x^2 + 4x + 3x + 12 $$
4. Combine like terms:
   $$ = x^2 + 7x + 12 $$

#### Self-Explanation Prompts:

- Why do we apply the distributive law in step 1?
- How does expanding each term in step 2 help in simplifying the expression?
- What is the purpose of combining like terms in step 4?

### Answers to Self-Explanation Prompts:

- The distributive law is applied to multiply each term in one bracket by each term in the other. This ensures that all possible products are accounted for.
- Expanding each term makes it clear what terms we have and how they can be combined.
- Combining like terms simplifies the expression into a more manageable form, making it easier to understand or use in further calculations.

## Example 2: Both $$a$$ and $$b$$ are Negative

### Problem: Expand $$(x - 2)(x - 5)$$

#### Solution:

1. Apply the distributive law:
   $$ (x - 2)(x - 5) = x(x - 5) - 2(x - 5) $$
2. Expand each term:
   $$ = x \cdot x - x \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot x + 2 \cdot 5 $$
3. Simplify:
   $$ = x^2 - 5x - 2x + 10 $$
4. Combine like terms:
   $$ = x^2 - 7x + 10 $$

#### Self-Explanation Prompts:

- Why does the term $$-2(x - 5)$$ become $$-2x + 10$$ after expansion?
- What is the significance of the negative signs in front of $$a$$ and $$b$$?

### Answers to Self-Explanation Prompts:

- The term $$-2(x - 5)$$ is expanded by distributing $$-2$$ across both terms in the bracket, resulting in $$-2x + 10$$. The negative sign in front of the 2 changes the signs of the terms inside the bracket upon multiplication.
- The negative signs in front of $$a$$ and $$b$$ indicate subtraction. They affect the signs of the terms when expanded and combined, leading to different coefficients in the final expression.

## Example 3: One Negative and One Positive

### Problem: Expand $$(x + 6)(x - 3)$$

#### Solution:

1. Apply the distributive law:
   $$ (x + 6)(x - 3) = x(x - 3) + 6(x - 3) $$
2. Expand each term:
   $$ = x \cdot x - x \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot x - 6 \cdot 3 $$
3. Simplify:
   $$ = x^2 - 3x + 6x - 18 $$
4. Combine like terms:
   $$ = x^2 + 3x - 18 $$

#### Self-Explanation Prompts:

- How does the presence of one negative and one positive constant affect the expansion?
- Why do we get a different type of term (positive and negative) in the final expression?

### Answers to Self-Explanation Prompts:

- The presence of one negative and one positive constant leads to a mix of positive and negative terms when expanded. This is because the negative constant introduces subtraction, while the positive constant introduces addition.
- The different types of terms in the final expression result from the combination of positive and negative products. The signs of the constants dictate whether the terms they produce upon expansion add to or subtract from the total value of the expression.
