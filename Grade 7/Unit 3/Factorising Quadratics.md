# Lecture Notes on Factorising Quadratic Expressions

## Introduction

Factorising quadratic expressions is a fundamental skill in algebra. A quadratic expression is typically in the form $$ ax^2 + bx + c $$, where $$ a $$, $$ b $$, and $$ c $$ are constants, and $$ a $$ is not zero. In this lecture, we will focus on quadratic expressions where $$ a = 1 $$, thus the form $$ x^2 + bx + c $$.

## The Cross Method

The Cross Method is a technique used to factorise a quadratic expression of the form $$ x^2 + bx + c $$. The goal is to find two binomials that multiply to give the original quadratic expression. 

### The Logic Behind the Method

When we factorize $$ x^2 + bx + c $$, we are looking for two binomials of the form $$ (x + m)(x + n) $$ that, when multiplied, give us the original quadratic expression. The product of these binomials can be expanded as follows:

$$
(x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + nx + mx + mn
$$

Notice that the middle terms ($$ nx $$ and $$ mx $$) add up to $$ bx $$, and the constant term $$ mn $$ is $$ c $$. Therefore, $$ m $$ and $$ n $$ must be numbers that satisfy two conditions:

1. **They add up to $$ b $$**: $$ m + n = b $$
2. **They multiply to $$ c $$**: $$ mn = c $$

### Steps to Factorise Using the Cross Method

1. **Identify $$ b $$ and $$ c $$**: In the expression $$ x^2 + bx + c $$, identify the coefficients $$ b $$ and $$ c $$.
2. **Find two numbers that multiply to $$ c $$ and add to $$ b $$**: These numbers will be used in the binomials.
3. **Write the factorised form**: The quadratic expression can be written as $$ (x + m)(x + n) $$, where $$ m $$ and $$ n $$ are the numbers found in step 2.

## Examples

### Example 1: Both b and c are Positive
**Expression**: $$ x^2 + 7x + 12 $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = 7 $$ and $$ c = 12 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to 7. These numbers are 3 and 4.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x + 3)(x + 4) $$.

**Self-Explanation Prompt**: Why do 3 and 4 work in this example? How do they relate to the values of b and c?

**Answer**: The numbers 3 and 4 work because their product is 12 (which is $$ c $$) and their sum is 7 (which is $$ b $$). This satisfies the conditions needed for the Cross Method of factorisation.

### Example 2: b is Negative, c is Positive
**Expression**: $$ x^2 - 5x + 6 $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = -5 $$ and $$ c = 6 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x - 2)(x - 3) $$.

**Self-Explanation Prompt**: Consider how the negative signs of -2 and -3 contribute to the sum and product needed for b and c.

**Answer**: The negative signs in -2 and -3 are crucial because they allow the sum of the numbers to be -5 (which is $$ b $$) while their product remains positive at 6 (which is $$ c $$). This combination of negative and positive values is key in factorisation when b is negative and c is positive.

### Example 3: Both b and c are Negative
**Expression**: $$ x^2 - 8x + 15 $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = -8 $$ and $$ c = 15 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need numbers that multiply to 15 and add up to -8. These numbers are -3 and -5.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x - 3)(x - 5) $$.

**Self-Explanation Prompt**: How do the values of -3 and -5 align with the negative values of b and c? What happens if you multiply and add these numbers?

**Answer**: The values -3 and -5 align with the negative value of b because their sum is -8. Their product is positive 15, which is the value of c. This example illustrates how two negative numbers can sum up to a negative number while their product is positive.

### Example 4: b is Positive, c is Negative
**Expression**: $$ x^2 + 4x - 21 $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = 4 $$ and $$ c = -21 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need numbers that multiply to -21 and add up to 4. These numbers are 7 and -3.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x + 7)(x - 3) $$.

**Self-Explanation Prompt**: Why does one number need to be positive and the other negative in this case? How do these numbers achieve the required sum and product?

**Answer**: In this case, one number needs to be positive and the other negative because their product must be negative (as $$ c = -21 $$). The combination of 7 and -3 gives a product of -21 and a sum of 4, which aligns with the values of c and b respectively. This demonstrates the importance of sign consideration in factorisation when dealing with a negative c.

## Conclusion

The Cross Method is a straightforward way to factorise quadratic expressions of the form $$ x^2 + bx + c $$. By finding two numbers that satisfy the conditions of multiplying to $$ c $$ and adding to $$ b $$, we can easily write the factorised form of the expression. Remember, practice is key to mastering this technique.
