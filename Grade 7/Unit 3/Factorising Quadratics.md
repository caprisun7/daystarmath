# Lecture Notes on Factorising Quadratic Expressions

## Introduction

In the previous section we looked at how to expand the product of two brackets such as $$ (x+m)(x+n) $$, where $$ m $$ and $$ n $$ are some constant number. After expansion, we get an expression in the form of $$ x^2 + bx + c $$, where $$ a $$, $$ b $$, and $$ c $$ are some constant numbers. In this section, we'll explore factorisation, which is the reverse proccess of expanding brackets. Specifically, given an expression of the form $$ x^2 + bx + c $$, how do we revert it back to a product of two brackets in the form of $$ (x+m)(x+n) $$.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Factorise**: $$ x^2 + 7x + 12 $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = 7 $$ and $$ c = 12 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to 7. These numbers are 3 and 4.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x + 3)(x + 4) $$.

**Self-explanation exercise (Criteria C)**: Why do we have to find two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to 7?

**Answer**: We are looking for two brackets of the form $$ (x + m)(x + n) $$ that, when multiplied, give us $$ x^2 + 7x + 12 $$. But $$ (x + m)(x + n) $$ also expands to $$ x^2 + nx + mx + mn $$. This means

$$
 x^2 + 7x + 12 = (x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + nx + mx + mn
$$

Notice that the middle terms ($$ nx $$ and $$ mx $$) add up to $$ 7x $$, and the constant term $$ mn $$ is $$ 12 $$. Therefore, $$ m $$ and $$ n $$ must be numbers that satisfy two conditions:

1. **They add up to $$ 7 $$**: $$ m + n = 7 $$
2. **They multiply to $$ 12 $$**: $$ mn = 12 $$


### Example 2: 
**Expression**: $$ x^2 + 6 - 5x $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = -5 $$ and $$ c = 6 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x - 2)(x - 3) $$.

**Self-explanation exercise (Criteria C)**: Why $$ b = -5 $$ and $$ c = 6 $$, shouldn't $$ b $$ be the middle number and $$ c $$ be the last nubmber?

**Answer**: No, $$ b $$ and $$ c $$ are not necessarily the middle and last number. $$ b $$ is the coeffficent of $$ x $$ (i.e. the number multiplied to the unknown variable $$ x $$) and c the number by itself not multiplied to any unknown variable.

### Example 3:
**Expression**: $$ x^2 - 15 - 2x $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = -2 $$ and $$ c = 15 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need numbers that multiply to 15 and add up to -2. These numbers are 3 and -5.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x + 3)(x - 5) $$.

**Self-explanation exercise (Criteria C)**: Why do we have to find two numbers that multiply to -15 and add up to -2?

**Answer**: We are looking for two brackets of the form $$ (x + m)(x + n) $$ that, when multiplied, give us $$ x^2 - 15 - 2x$$. But $$ (x + m)(x + n) $$ also expands to $$ x^2 + nx + mx + mn $$. This means

$$
 x^2 - 15 - 2x = (x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + nx + mx + mn
$$

Notice that the middle terms ($$ nx $$ and $$ mx $$) add up to $$ -2x $$, and the constant term $$ mn $$ is $$ -15 $$. Therefore, $$ m $$ and $$ n $$ must be numbers that satisfy two conditions:

1. **They add up to $$ -2 $$**: $$ m + n = -2 $$
2. **They multiply to $$ -15 $$**: $$ mn = -15 $$


### Example 4: b is Positive, c is Negative
**Expression**: $$ x^2 + 4x - 21 $$

1. **Identify b and c**: Here, $$ b = 4 $$ and $$ c = -21 $$.
2. **Find two numbers**: We need numbers that multiply to -21 and add up to 4. These numbers are 7 and -3.
3. **Factorise**: The expression can be written as $$ (x + 7)(x - 3) $$.

## Conclusion

We presented a straightforward way to factorise quadratic expressions of the form $$ x^2 + bx + c $$. By finding two numbers that satisfy the conditions of multiplying to $$ c $$ and adding to $$ b $$, we can easily write the factorised form of the expression. Remember, practice is key to mastering this technique.
