# Lecture Notes on Graphing Linear Equations on a Coordinate Plane

## Introduction

Graphing linear equations is an essential skill in algebra, enabling students to visualize how equations represent relationships between variables. This lecture will focus on identifying solutions to linear equations and how these solutions can be represented graphically on a coordinate plane.

## Part 1: Understanding Solutions to Linear Equations

### Example 1: Equation $$ y = 2x + 3 $$

- **Solution Check**: 
  - Is \( (1, 5) \) a solution? \( y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \). Yes, since \( 5 = 5 \).
  - Is \( (0, 3) \) a solution? \( y = 2(0) + 3 = 3 \). Yes, since \( 3 = 3 \).
- **Non-Solution Check**: 
  - Is \( (2, 5) \) a solution? \( y = 2(2) + 3 = 7 \). No, since \( 5 \neq 7 \).
  - Is \( (1, 4) \) a solution? \( y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \). No, since \( 4 \neq 5 \).

**Self-Explanation Prompt**: Why do we choose different values of x to find solutions?

**Answer**: Choosing different values of x helps us find multiple points that satisfy the equation, aiding in accurately drawing the line on the graph.

## Part 2: Plotting Solutions on a Coordinate Plane

### Example 2: Equation \( y = -x + 2 \)

1. **Finding Points**:
   - Solutions: \( (0, 2) \), \( (1, 1) \), \( (2, 0) \), \( (-1, 3) \).
   - Non-solutions: \( (0, 0) \), \( (2, 2) \).

2. **Plotting Points and Drawing Line**:
   - Plot the solutions and non-solutions on the coordinate plane.
   - Draw a line through the solution points.

**Self-Explanation Prompt**: How do we turn solutions into points on the graph?

**Answer**: Each solution \( (x, y) \) represents a point on the graph. The \( x \) value determines the position left or right, and the \( y \) value determines the position up or down on the coordinate plane.

### Example 3: Equation \( y = 3x - 4 \)

1. **Finding Points**:
   - Solutions: \( (0, -4) \), \( (1, -1) \), \( (2, 2) \), \( (-1, -7) \).
   - Non-solutions: \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 0) \).

2. **Plotting Points and Drawing Line**:
   - Plot the solutions and non-solutions on the coordinate plane.
   - Draw a line through the solution points.

**Self-Explanation Prompt**: Why do the points of solutions form a line?

**Answer**: The points of solutions form a line because each pair \( (x, y) \) follows the same rule set by the equation. When we connect these points, they naturally form a straight line, showing the consistent relationship defined by the equation.

## Conclusion

- **Understanding Solutions**: A solution to a linear equation is a pair of \( x \) and \( y \) values that satisfy the equation. Non-solutions do not satisfy the equation.
- **Graphing on Coordinate Plane**: When we plot the solutions of a linear equation on a coordinate plane, they form a straight line. This line represents the consistent relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) as defined by the equation.

These concepts help students visualize the relationship between variables in a linear equation and understand the importance of graphing in algebra.
